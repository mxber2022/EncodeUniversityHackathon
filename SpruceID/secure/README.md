# Decentralized Password Manager using Spruce Decentralized Identity

Welcome to the Decentralized Password Manager powered by Spruce Decentralized Identity! This project allows you to securely manage your passwords using decentralized identity technology and even resolves ENS (Ethereum Name Service) addresses.


## Introduction

In the digital age, managing passwords securely is of utmost importance. The Decentralized Password Manager leverages the power of Spruce Decentralized Identity to provide you with a robust and secure solution for managing your passwords.

## ENS Resolution

We've integrated Ethereum Name Service (ENS) resolution to enhance user experience. Instead of dealing with complex Ethereum addresses, you can associate your accounts with human-readable ENS addresses.

## Features

- **Decentralized Identity:** Leverage the security of decentralized identity to store and manage your passwords.
- **ENS Resolution:** Associate your accounts with ENS addresses for a more user-friendly experience.
- **Password Encryption:** Your passwords are encrypted before being stored, ensuring your data's privacy.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** The Next.js-based UI provides an intuitive and responsive user experience.
