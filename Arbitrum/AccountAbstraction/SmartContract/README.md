# Hardhat Project 

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a NFT contract ERC721, a script that deploys and verify the contract on Arbitrum Nova.

Try running the following tasks to deploy contract:

```shell
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <network> 

```

Try running the following tasks to verify contract:

```shell
npx hardhat verify --network Nova 0xCF905a8a4e1A0107aABe933de8f4F78E3A4f4E72

```
